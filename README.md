# Advent of Code

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the **Advent of Code** challenges!

This repository contains my solutions to the daily programming puzzles published each year during **Advent of Code**, a 25-day challenge featuring problems that range from easy to highly complex.

## Contents

Each folder in the repository contains the solutions for each day's challenges order by the year they were published:

``` text

â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ problem.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## How can I view the solutions?

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sr-cheese/adventofcode.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder for the day you want to view. Solutions are organized by day within the year directory.

3. Each solution is provided in a Python file. To run the solutions, you just need Python installed along with the input data for the day.

    Example of running a solution in Python:

    ``` bash
    python3 2024/1/part_1.py
    python3 2024/1/part_2.py
    ```

## Language and Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries used**: Depending on the solution, I may use standard libraries like `collections`, `itertools`, or `math`.

## Challenge Description

Each Advent of Code challenge features a special theme and varies in difficulty. Typical objectives include:

- **Processing strings** and performing manipulations.
- **Solving mathematical puzzles** and finding patterns.
- **Working with algorithms** to optimize runtime.

Hope you enjoy solving the challenges as much as I do! ðŸŽ„âœ¨
